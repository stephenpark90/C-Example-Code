=== *Section 1: Summarize the Fundamentals of Programming*

* *Objective 1:*
** 1.1 Understand what a computer program is
** 1.2 Understand the purpose of programming languages
** 1.3 Understand interpreted versus compiled

* *Objective 2: Understand the compiling/linking process for C programs*
** 2.1 Understand what source code is
** 2.2 Understand what compiling/compiler is and the resulting output

* *Objective 3: Describe the basic structure of a C program*
** 3.1 Identify the only required function
** 3.2 Identify what it typically means to `#include`
** 3.3 Understand case-sensitivity in C

* *Objective 4: Understand C syntax and semantics*
** 4.1 Understand that expressions evaluate to a value
** 4.2 Understand that statements have side-effects (does something)
** 4.3 Apply operator precedence in expression evaluation

* *Objective 5: Understand the C data types*
** 5.1 Evaluate data types based on size/purpose
** 5.2 Understand the `sizeof` operator
